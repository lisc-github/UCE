                <p>Travel and study abroad is the most traditional teaching method in the world education history. In western countries, 5 eastern scholars studying abroad were written about in the Bible; in eastern countries, thousands of years ago Confucius headed all his disciples to travel around kingdoms in China, so as to increase their knowledge, develop their characters and broaden their vision.</p>

                        <h1>Overview</h1>
                        <p>Many American students come to China to study the language and the culture, and some choose their favorite subjects such as Chinese medicine, acupuncture, and even engineering. This is a big decision to make, and you need to decide what’s best for you and what you want to get out of this experience.</p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Granted, studying the language is difficult, and living in a very different environment sounds intimidating, but those who make it will not regret. English speakers who know Chinese are far rarer than Chinese speakers who know English – this alone is an opportunity for you. You may have a regular 9-to-5 work life in the United States after you graduate, as a teller at a local bank, or a sales person at a shopping mall, or, a busy young employee in a law firm, you may get paid every two weeks and then count on it till you retire. But in China, the world’s fastest growing economy, things will work out bit differently but amazingly for someone like you, one that can connect the western world and China. If say, the United States is a fully grown mature man, then China is a young fellow. It can bring you all the excitement and feeling of fulfillment. The opportunity is enormous, and you’ll have a life path, different from your peers at home, one that’s not counting on the pay check every two weeks, but rather lively.</p>

                                        <p>In order to get the best of it when you’re “Studying Abroad”, it is quite essential how to select a right school for yourself. For Chinese language study, there’re many special language schools at your choice in China, and some language institutes set by universities can also be very good choices. Whichever choice you make, either to study at the language schools or language institutes at universities, the following conditions should be considered well before you make the decision.</p>
                                        <p>(1).Whether the school approved by local Education Bureau, the school history and popularity, and whether it has a whole set of Audio/Video learning material and the library equipment at your service whenever you want to look up something.</p>
                                        <p>(2).The school faculty and class size are also very important. Teachers at a formal university at least hold a bachelor’s degree. They have received formal training on teaching language, passed related exams and been granted the teaching certificates.</p>
                                        <p>(3).Whether the school has the credits granting qualification, or whether the credits be accepted by US universities and colleges.</p>
                                        <p>(4).The geographical location of the school, and whether it’s beneficial to your Chinese language learning and contact with the culture.</p>

Therefore, when the students choose to participate in a “Study Abroad” program, course contents should be considered first, not where to travel. You should pay attention to the following:</p>
                                        <p>(1).Do you need to learn the course?</p>
                                        <p>(2).Are you interested in it?</p>
                                        <p>(3).How many credits can you earn from it?</p>

                                        <h2>How to Select a Right Place to Live in China?</h2>
                                        <p>For students who participate in the Study Abroad Program, tuition fee and traveling expenses, instead of luxurious accommodation, should take up most of the costs. Hotels that cost too much money are certainly out of the question. Normally, there’re two rational choices: school dormitory and boarding family .</p>
                                        <p>The greatest advantage of boarding family is that it’s easy to get to know local people’s customs, social manners, and values. However, cultural shock cannot be avoided when you’re living in a foreign country. You may even feel not getting along with your boarding family quite often. All this will become a problem to your life of studying aboard and you’ll feel somewhat stuck in there sometimes. Therefore, the best accommodation choice for studying abroad would still be school dormitory.</p>
                                        <p>Apart from its safety and stability, convenience for your study, and easy management, living in a school dormitory offers you a great chance to know your peer’s life, to make as many friends as possible, and to have more chances to participate in various activities. Since you don’t have to live according to boarding family’s time schedule, you’ll have more freedom. Thus is why living in school dormitories becomes so popular among students studying abroad.</p>

                                        <h2>How to Select a route in China?</h2>
                                        <p>In modern time, the formal Study Abroad, also called “Studying While Sightseeing”, was originated from England and it has more than 100 years history till now. Its original purpose of this program a tour aimed at providing school students to enrich their knowledge, broaden their eye horizons, increase exchange and social experience, so as to coordinate their study in the school and fill up their deficiencies. Participants mostly come from universities and high schools. It focuses on Learning. There is usually a special topic, either to conduct a research on a culture and the customs, to know a subject, or to learn a language. Therefore, the contents of the tour and the designing of the routes are organized around “What to Learn”, thus making the program professional, informative and interesting. In this way, students will learn from the tour more systematically. Practice has proved that this studying method is greatly beneficial to cultivate students’ bodies and minds and to enhance their language abilities.</p>
                                        <p>However, the traditional “Study Abroad” is relatively confined within a certain school in one city of a country, all one student can experience is just a small part of the country’s culture and can oly feel a little about the language atmosphere. Especially in big country like China with profound cultural connotation, in that way, students would only get one-sided studying and living experience.</p>
