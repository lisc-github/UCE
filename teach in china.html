                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    You are wondering whether you should go to China and teach and, if you go, how you will grow and change and what benefits you will derive. Here are some observations.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>"One half year or a year in China will give you the opportunity to teach some bright and dedicated students. You will form profound and long lasting friendships with colleagues and students. It will give you the chance to travel to the most amazingly beautiful and geographically and culturally diverse places in the world, not as a tourist, but as an insider-someone who is living and working in the country. It will give you insight into the oldest, most populated, culturally rich and complex society on earth. You will observe and participate in the fastest growing economy of any nation in the world today. You will also witness poverty, bureaucratic suffocation, and crowding of terrifying proportions. You will learn to love the country so much that at times you may hate it with a passion, but you will always want to go back".</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>UCE not only offers English teaching opportunities in China, but also highly desired professional teaching opportunities in varies subjects to those with teaching experience as well as those who are not currently teachers but working in the industries of related subjects.</p>
