                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    The TESL (Teach English as a Second Language)  Summer Program in China is a unique teaching and learning opportunity which offers individuals a chance to spend the summer teaching English, studying Chinese, and taking part in a meaningful cultural exchange among countries long misunderstood by one another. It is designed for those who want to receive a TESL Certificate within a few weeks in the summer while immersing in the Chinese culture and way of life.  After days of training and orientation in the U.S. and China, participants will spend 7 weeks ( 8 weeks for some  schools) teaching English to school students in the classroom as regular teacher, learning the Chinese language and culture and traveling in China.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    Program participants usually stay as a group of 2 to 10 at one site, teaching English to several classes of school students 6 sessions per day, and 6 teaching days per week in average. In addition, participants will spend 1 hour every other evening having all kinds of fun activities with students. The emphasis of classes is conversational English and North American culture, though some grammar may be taught as well. Besides these formal teaching and learning duties, there are a number of other cultural enrichment activities that both American teachers and their students will participate. Participants will stay in housing located on the school’s campus or in local hotels, with meals provided in their dining halls. The absolute minimum is a furnished room, with bath or shower, and air-conditioner. Some sites provide a television, a refrigerator, and a telephone in the room. Internet and/or Wi-Fi is available in the room. Double occupancy applies in hotels. Single or double occupancy is provided if stay on campus.
